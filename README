Parallel Copy

This product is only assured to build under Linux.  It *may* work on
other platforms, but until it gets autoconfiscated, there are no
guarantees.  To build from scratch, you must have the AutoGen project
fully installed, version 5.16 or later.

As of 5/1/2012, it has not been released.  :) Be patient.

Meantime, please untar pcopy-gen.tar, touch stamp-pcopy-opts and then
touch pcopy-opts.[ch].  This will keep "make" from trying to rebuild the
generated files.
